# Flood Prediction Website

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of a flood in a specific city based on real-time weather data. Designed with simplicity and accuracy in mind, this tool helps users, authorities, and organizations take precautionary measures during uncertain weather conditions.



## üåç About the Project

Floods are one of the most frequent and devastating natural disasters, especially in regions with erratic weather patterns and inadequate infrastructure. This project aims to serve as a predictive early-warning tool by utilizing weather data to forecast flood risk using a trained machine learning model.

The goal is to build a lightweight and user-friendly platform that can:
- Monitor real-time weather conditions
- Analyze critical meteorological factors
- Predict flood risks with high accuracy
- Provide actionable insights to users in affected regions

This project is ideal for academic research, smart city applications, and early disaster warning systems.



## üåü Features

- **High-Accuracy Predictions**  
  Trained on a balanced dataset with over 5,000 records, achieving a 99% accuracy rate on test data using a Random Forest Classifier.

- **Live Weather Integration**  
  Integrates with the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) to pull current temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and more.

- **Clean UI**  
  Responsive, intuitive frontend designed with basic HTML, CSS, and JS for a fast and accessible user experience.

- **200+ City Search Capability**  
  Users can input a city name, which is matched to a built-in dataset of over 200 city coordinates for live weather prediction.

- **Result Transparency**  
  Shows both the prediction label ("Flood" or "No Flood") and the model‚Äôs confidence as a percentage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. User enters the name of a city.
2. The system fetches real-time weather data using the Visual Crossing API.
3. Selected weather parameters are passed into the pre-trained Random Forest model.
4. The model predicts the probability of a flood.
5. The result is displayed to the user along with a confidence score.
